1. Which class would you use to store your birthday in years, months, days, seconds, and nanoseconds?
    I would use the LocalDateTime class because by using the 'of' method I'm able to create a LocalDateTime with the fields:
    years, months, days, seconds, and nanoseconds.

2. Given a random date, how would you find the date of the previous Thursday?
    Refer to DateTimeAPI.java

3. What is the difference between a ZoneId and a ZoneOffset?
	ZoneID is a representation of the time-zone given.
	ZoneOffset defines the fixed offset of the current time-zone with GMT/UTC.

4. How would you convert an Instant to a ZonedDateTime? How would you convert a ZonedDateTime to an Instant?
    To convert an Instant to a ZonedDateTime I would use the 'ofInstant' method of ZoneDateTime.
    to convert ZonedDateTime to an Instant I would use the 'toInstant' method.
